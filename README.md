<h1> 2D Video Game Project </h1>
<h2>VISA 106 - Introduction to Digital Media II</h2>

The task was to design a video game in Unity based on a fictional character. This included creating all the assets and learning how to navigate the Unity interface and use C#. 

The character design, background, and all interactive elements were creating in Adobe Illustrator.

My project is a 2D Scrolling Game featuring Ophelia, based on the character sharing the same name from Shakespeare's Hamlet. More information on the design and process can be found in the pdf files within.
